# Vítor Fernandes


I've been around the block with hybrid environments (you know, the classic Linux/Windows, Cloud/On-prem mix that costs *way too much* to maintain). My day-to-day is keeping critical systems from falling over, doing **security hardening** before pentests make us cry, and automating everything I can so I don't have to do it twice. I live in the terminal, enjoy wrestling with poorly designed databases, and have a special taste for infrastructure that *actually scales* without requiring a PhD to maintain.

Started at [ATEC](https://www.atec.pt/) with electronics and automation, then did **1500 hours** of intensive training at [CINEL](https://www.cinel.pt/appv2) (C/C++, Java, web fundamentals) where I finished with 19/20 on the final project. Right after that I joined DUPLOCLIQUE as an intern and, over 6 years, went from *"do some sysadmin tasks"* to leading the company's entire **cloud/AWS migration**.

The 2021 gig at **MIKE DAVIS** was... *educational*. I showed up and there was no documentation, no handover, nothing. My first day was basically doing forensic archaeology on a legacy system *held together with duct tape*, and rebuilding the whole thing while the business was live. Fun times.

First thing I did was introduce some basic 21st-century concepts, like the company's **first-ever domain controller**. The existing "security model" was, creatively, a *completely flat network*. Fixed that real quick, segmented it into isolated subnets (HQ, warehouse, stores).

Then I became the entire IT department. **Solo**. Everything was on me: SAP B1/HANA stack, all servers (on-prem and IaaS), networking, POS systems nationwide. Oh, and all vendor contracts, procurement, and—naturally—the **24/7 support line** for 100+ employees, which *apparently didn't respect holidays*.

In my "spare time" I built a **C# reconciler** to fix critical accounting errors and a **Python pipeline** to automate SAFT tax submissions from SAP HANA. My final act was replacing their *surprisingly resilient* paper-based GDPR process with a custom web app.

Now I'm deepening my **Kubernetes and Terraform** game while exploring infrastructure patterns that *actually scale* without needing a PhD to maintain. If you're passing through Porto and want to talk containers or badly designed databases, **hit me up**.
