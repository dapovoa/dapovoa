I spend most of my time writing code that automates things people don't want to do manually. If there's a repetitive process that takes hours, I'll build something to do it in seconds. I work a lot with Python and C#, building APIs, data pipelines, and systems that need to run without supervision.

Started with electronics and automation at [ATEC](https://www.atec.pt/) in Palmela, then did 1500 hours at [CINEL](https://www.cinel.pt/appv2) learning C/C++, Java, and web fundamentals. Finished with 18/20, final project got 19/20. Right after that, landed an internship at DUPLOCLIQUE and stayed 6 years. Grew with the company from sysadmin work to leading cloud migrations and AWS deployments.

In 2021, moved to MIKE DAVIS where I basically had to rebuild everything from scratch. No onboarding, no documentation, just legacy systems and duct tape. Set up the entire infrastructure from the ground up: domain controllers, network segmentation (stores, warehouse, HQ, guest networks), fixed wide-open security holes. Managed the full SAP B1/HANA stack, refactored the POS system to eliminate manual errors, and built automation to handle things like cascading discount discrepancies with automatic journal entries. Created ETL pipelines for daily sales reporting across all stores and wrote recovery scripts for SUSE SLES and Windows Server. Also built a GDPR compliance web system to replace their paper-based process.

I'm comfortable in the terminal, enjoy working with databases, and have a thing for making infrastructure behave predictably. Currently learning the Kubernetes/Terraform stack because containers are eating the world.
