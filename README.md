# Vítor Fernandes

**Infrastructure Engineer** specializing in automation, data pipelines, and cloud systems. I transform operational challenges into stable, scalable solutions across hybrid environments.

With 9 years of experience, I've built production infrastructure from zero foundation, architected 24/7 monitoring systems, and developed ETL pipelines processing critical business data. My focus is bridging infrastructure and software engineering using Python, IaC, and data-driven automation.
