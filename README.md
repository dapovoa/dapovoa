I build code that automates the boring stuff. If a process is repetitive and slow, I make it instant. I mostly use Python and C# to build resilient APIs, data pipelines, and autonomous systems that don't need a babysitter.

My foundation is in electronics and automation from ATEC, followed by a 1500-hour deep-dive at CINEL into C/C++, Java, and web fundamentals where I finished with top marks (19/20 on the final project). I immediately joined DUPLOCLIQUE as an intern and, over 6 years, went from sysadmin tasks to leading the company's cloud and AWS migration efforts as it grew.

My 2021 role at MIKE DAVIS was a crash course in forensic IT. With no documentation or handover, my first job was to reverse-engineer a legacy system held together with duct tape and then rebuild it, all while the business was live.

First, I introduced some 21st-century fundamentals, starting with the company's first-ever domain controller. The existing 'security model' was, creatively, a single, wide-open network. I fixed that, segmenting it into properly isolated subnets for the HQ, warehouse, and stores.

I then became the de facto one-man IT department. That meant sole ownership of everything: the SAP B1/HANA stack, all servers (on-prem/IaaS), networking, and POS systems nationwide. It also meant handling all vendor contracts, procurement, and-naturally-the 24/7 on-call support line for 100+ employees, which apparently didn't observe holidays.

In my 'spare time', I built a C# reconciler to fix critical accounting errors and a Python pipeline to automate SAFT tax submissions from SAP HANA. My final act was to replace their surprisingly resilient paper-based GDPR process with a custom web application.

I live in the terminal, enjoy wrangling databases, and get a kick out of making infrastructure predictable. I'm currently tackling the Kubernetes/Terraform stack-because, let's face it, containers are eating the world.
